## Introduction  

Many of the problems you will encounter in computer programming courses will require a basic knowledge of geometry to solve. In this and the next lesson, we'll cover some aspects of the three most common shapes you'll work with: squares, other rectangles, and circles. Here we learn how to calculate the area and perimeter for rectangles (including squares).
