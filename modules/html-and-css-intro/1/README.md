## Introduction  

Put some introductory material here


## Exercises  

Work through [Learn HTML & CSS Part 1](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css) on Codecademy to learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.  

This may take up to 10 hours to work through. IMPORTANT for code campers, let them know they may not get all the 
way through it before python/2nd week starts and that's OK.
