## Introduction  

As a programmer, you will frequently have to create and use zip files. When you want to email your project to someone, you will need to "zip" the folder containing your project's files before you can send it. And when you download someone else's project (or a software application you want to install), you will need to "unzip" their files to use them. In this video we will learn how to both create and open zip files on both Mac and Windows.
