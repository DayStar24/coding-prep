## Introduction  

This lesson and the next three lessons will give you an overview of your file system and how to manage it. It is important to understand files and folders for a few reasons.  
* You will need to create file structures for all of your coding projects. 
* You will also be regularly locating, moving, coping, and renaming files and folders. 
* When you install new software you will need to locate the files you've downloaded, unzip them, and recognize what kind of file types they are.  

In this lesson we will learn how to identify different file types by their extensions.
