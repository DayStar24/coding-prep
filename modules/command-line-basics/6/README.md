## Introduction  

This lesson is different from the previous video lessons because it features a Windows command prompt. The purpose of including this video is so that you can better understand the `PATH` variable. As a coder, you will frequently need to download programs and add them to your `PATH` variable so that your computer can find and use these programs to perform certain tasks.  

The key points to get from this video are:  
* The difference between the relative and absolute paths  
* Putting quotes around any directories that have spaces in the names  
* What your `PATH` variable does (why you want to add certain executables to your `PATH`) 

### Important!  
For both Windows Git Bash and Mac users alike, the way to print out your PATH variable is to enter `echo $PATH`.
