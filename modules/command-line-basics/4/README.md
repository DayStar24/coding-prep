## Introduction  

Let's learn about the `find` command and how to use it with different arguments so that we can find files and directories that match various criteria. In this lesson we'll learn the following commands and arguments:  
* `find`  
* `find .`  
* `-type d`  
* `-type f`  
* `-name`  
* `*`  
* `-mmin`  
* `-atime`  
* `-empty`  
* `-perm`  
* `-exec`  
* `-maxdepth`

## Exercises  

Go to [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) and work through Exercises 12, 13, and 15. These exercises will supplement what we've learned so far by added the `less`, `more`, `cat` and `exit` commands to your command line repertoire.  
**IMPORTANT**: Note that for Windows Git Bash users, the `less` and `more` commands will not work. Only the `cat` command you learn in Exercise 13 will work from among these read-file commands.
