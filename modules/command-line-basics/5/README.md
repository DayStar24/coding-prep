## Introduction  

As a coder, you'll be doing **A LOT** of typing! So learning some keyboard shortcuts will make you a more efficient programmer. In this lesson we learn the following shortcuts (among others):  
* `CTRL + a`  
* `CTRL + e`  
* `OPTION + click`  
* `CTRL + u`  
* `CTRL + k`  
* `TAB`  
* `history`  
* `CTRL + r`  
* `CTRL + l`  
* `CMD + k`  
### Important!  
Note that for **Windows Git Bash** users, there is no equivalent for the `OPTION + click` shortcut. Also, the drag and drop technique for changing directories will not work. And to clear the scrollback on Git Bash, use the command `clear` instead of `CMD +k`.
