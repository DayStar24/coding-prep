## Introduction  

Now that we can confidently navigate our file system, let's start making changes to our files and folders! In this lesson we'll learn the following commands: 
* `mkdir`  
* `touch`  
* `open`  
* `cp`  
* `rm`  
* `-R`  
* `-rf`  
* `mv`  
* `man`  

### Important!  
For Windows Git Bash users, instead of the command `open` use the command `start`. Also, the `man` command will not work and there is no equivalent substitute.
