## Linear Equations   

Note: For all of these problems, the goal is to isolate the variable "n" on one side  
**Question 1:**  
8 + n = 13  

**Answer:** 5  
(8 + n) - 8 = 13 - 8  
n = 5  

**Question 2:**  
n / 5 = 12  

**Answer:** 60  
(n / 5) \* 5 = 12 \* 5  
n = 60  

**Question 3:**  
6n = 24  

**Answer:** 4  
(6n) / 6 = 24 / 6  
n = 4  

**Question 4:**  
36 = 48 - n  

**Answer:** 12  
36 = 48 + (-n)  
36 - 48 = -n  
-12 = -n  
-12 / -1 = -n / -1  
12 = n  

## Logarithms

## Averages  

**Question 1:**  
Over the course of 4 games, a basketball player scores 12, 20, 36, and 8 points. What is her average score per game?  

**Answer:** 19  
Let x represent the average score.  
(12 + 20 + 36 + 8) / 4 = x  
76 / 4 = x  
19 = x  

**Question 2:**  
Aidan received the following scores on his Chemistry tests: 80, 90, 70, 100, 70, 100. What is his average test score?  

**Answer:** 85  
(80 + 90 + 70 + 100 + 70 + 100) / 6 (number of tests taken) = x    
510 / 6 = x  
85 = x  

**Question 3:**  
Sally has an average exam score of 87 based on 3 Algebra exams taken so far. What score would Sally need to get on her next Algebra exam to bring her average score up to 90?  

**Answer: 99**  
Her sum for the last 4 exams was 261 (87 \* 3), so we need to add that to x (her potential score on the next exam), and divide by 4 (the total number of exams including the next one), and this must equal 90.  
(261 + x) / 4 = 90  
((261 + x) / 4 ) \* 4 = 90 \* 4  
261 + x = 360  
x = 360 - 261  
x = 99  

## Percentages  
**Question 1:**  
There are 36 students in a class and 9 of these students failed their History test. What percentage of these students failed their test?   

**Answer:** 25%  
Reframe question: 9 is what percent of 36? Let x = "what percent" and solve for x.  
9 = x \* 36  
9 / 36 = (x \* 36) / 36  
.25 = x  
(and .25 = 25%)  

**Question 2:**  
Paula spends $600 per month on rent. If that amount of money is 40% of her monthly income, then how much money does Paula make per month?  

**Answer:** $1500  
Reframe question: 600 is 40% of what number? Let x = "what number" and solve for x.  
40% of x = 600  
.4 \* x = 600  
(.4x) / .4 = 600 / .4  
x = 1500

**Question 3:**  
What is 55% of 40?

**Answer:** 22  
40 \* .55 = 22  

**Question 4:**  
What is .1% of 3000?  

**Answer:** 3  
3000 \* .001 = 3  

**Question 5:**  
A football team played 52 games in one season. They won nearly 90% of their games. About how many games did they win? (Round to the nearest whole number.)

**Answer:** 47  
Reframe question: What number is 90% of 52? Let x = "what number" and solve for x.  
x = 52 \* .90  
x = 46.8 (round up to 47, so x = 47)  

##  Perimeter and Area of Rectangles
Calculate the Area and Perimeter for each rectangle.  

**Question 1:**   
A square with sides that are 4 in long.

**Answer:** Area: 16 in^2, Perimeter: 16 in  
For the area, multiply 2 of the sides of the square and make sure the answer is marked inches squared.  
4 \* 4 = 16 in^2  
For the perimeter, add all sides of the square.  
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 in

**Question 2:**   
A rectangle with a length of 5 ft and a width of 3 ft.

**Answer:** Area: 15 ft^2, Perimeter: 16 ft   
For the area, multiply the length and width and make sure the answer is marked feet squared.  
5 \* 3 = 15 ft^2  
For the perimeter, add all sides of the rectange (so 2 lengths and 2 widths).  
(2 \* 5) + (2 \* 3)   
10 + 6 = 16 ft

**Question 3:**   
A rectangle with a length of 12 ft and a width of 6 ft.

**Answer:** Area: 72 ft^2, Perimeter: 36 ft   
For the area, multiply the length and width and make sure the answer is marked feet squared.  
12 \* 6 = 72 ft^2  
For the perimeter, add all sides of the rectange (so 2 lengths and 2 widths).  
(2 \* 12) + (2 \* 6)   
24 + 12 = 36 ft  

## Circles Part 1  
Use 3.14 for pi.  
**Question 1:**  
Given a circle with a diameter of 12 ft, what is its circumference?  

**Answer:** 37.68 ft  
The circumference is the diameter times pi (shortened to 3.14 here), so:  
12 \* 3.14 = 37.68  

**Question 2:**  
Given a circle with a diameter of 8 ft, what is its radius?  

**Answer:** 4 ft  
The radius is half the diameter, so:  
8 / 2 = 4  

**Question 3:**  
Given a circle with a circumference of 87.92 ft, what is its radius?  

**Answer:** 14 ft  
The circuference is 2 times the radius times pi, so if x represents the radius:  
2 \* 3.14 \* x = 87.92  
(6.28 \* x) / 6.28 = 87.92 / 6.28  
x = 14  

**Question 4:** 69.08 ft  
Given a circle with a radius of 11 ft, what is its circumference?  

**Answer:**  
11 \* 2 \* 3.14 = 69.08  

## Circles Part 2  
Use 3.14 for pi.  
**Question 1:**  
Given a circle with a diameter of 12 ft, what is its area?  

**Answer:** 113.04 ft^2  
area = pi \* radius^2 (and the radius is half the diameter) so:  
area = 3.14 \* 6^2  
area = 3.14 \* 36 = 113.04  

**Question 2:**  
Given a circle with a diameter of 8 ft, what is its area?  

**Answer:** 50.24 ft^2  
area = 3.14 \* 4^2  
area = 3.14 \* 16 = 50.24  

**Question 3:**  
Given a circle with a radius of 14 ft, what is its area?  

**Answer:** 615.44 ft^2  
area = 3.14 \* 14^2  
area = 3.14 \* 196 = 615.44  

**Question 4:**  
Given a circle with a radius of 11 ft, what is its area?  

**Answer:** 379.94 ft^2  
area = 3.14 \* 11^2  
area = 3.14 \* 121 = 379.94
