                    <p>This course was designed to prepare students to successfully complete the LaunchCode Code Camp curriculum. It can also be used as an independent course for students interested in learning computer programming, but not currently enrolled in a class.  </p>
<h2 id="why-learn-file-management-math-and-the-command-line">Why Learn File Management, Math, and the Command Line?</h2>
<p>These three subjects form the backbone of Unit 0's curriculum. They are all essential skills that people need to possess to become competent programmers. They are also the three areas where students can struggle the most if they have not already mastered the basics of each. By completing Unit 0, a student prepares herself for the coding learning journey to be a smoother process.  </p>
<h2 id="why-learn-git-markdown-html-and-css">Why Learn Git, Markdown, HTML, and CSS?</h2>
<p>These modules are presented as &quot;extras&quot; since they will be covered later in the Code Camp curriculum. But for students doing this course independently, as well as for Code Campers who want to work ahead, these two modules are essentials. The languages and tools they cover will enable you to quickly see code in action on the web.  </p>
<p>Coding is learned by <em>doing</em>, not from books alone. You've got to code something up and see it live; then fix the mistakes you'll inevitably find. So by making web pages at this early stage of your learning journey, you're getting a real taste for what will be a daily experience as you move forward with your programming career. And with Git in your arsenal, you can safely try new things without worrying about messing up what you've got working already!  </p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-curriculum">How to Use this Curriculum</h2>
<p>Begin with the very first module (File Management) and work all the way through the modules in the order they are presented. For each lesson in each module, first read the introduction, then watch the associated video (if there is one). Then you'll proceed to either a <strong>Review</strong> or <strong>Exercises</strong> section. If it is a <strong>Review</strong> section, then the problems you work through will have answers that you can check on the <strong>Answers Sheet</strong> via the link at the bottom of the page. If it is an <strong>Exercises</strong> section, then either there will not be answers provided, or the exercises are on an external resource that may have the answers available as you work through the resource.  </p>
<p>If you notice anything that's incorrect in this unit, or if have any suggestions for improvement, check out the <a href="../issues/">Reporting Issues</a> section in the top menu.  </p>
<p>Thanks and good luck! You're about to begin a transformational journey into a coding career, and we're excited for you!</p>
