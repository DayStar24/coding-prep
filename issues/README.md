Issues should be reported as [issues on the GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/coding-prep/issues). You will need to create a GitHub account in order to create issues.

We also appreciate suggestions for enhancements to the course site or course material via GitHub issues.
